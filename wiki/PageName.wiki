Presentation Notes

 * For our game, we want a UI that is simple and easy to learn, understand and use
 * The following is an approximation and simplification of what our UI will look like
 * Sample turn:  when it is someone's turn, a user can use cursorKeys/joypad to select  item
 * when cursor passess over unit, unit's information appears here-
 * when unit is selected, menu appears
 * there is also world map, load/save option menu
