=Assignment 1: Project Plan and Website=

_.... so we haven't 'finished' a lot...._

    1. Design your project website. Include the following information:
          * Team name. _done_
          * Full name, student #, and email address of each team member. _Emailed Toby about the student # thing, he replied almost right away back saying we can just list the full names + email addresses_
          * A list of three 1-hour time slots during the week when your entire team is able to meet on the Surrey campus. We may use these times to schedule meetings with instructors/TAs. _done, see calendar_
          * The project manager (PM) for this assignment. The PM is responsible for organizing meetings, recording and distributing meeting minutes, and any other administrative tasks that need to be taken care of (such as submitting assignments!). Your team will need to decide who the PM will be for each assignment. _Assignment 1 PM - Karl_
          * A clear indication for which assignment this is being submitted, i.e. put "Assignment #1: Project Plan and Website" in big letters at the top of the page. For future assignments, replace this with the name of that assignment.
          * A table of contents linking to the 5 assignments. You don't need any content yet, but you should provide templates and "stubs" for all the content.
          * Write a project description. Describe your project in a way that a non-CS SFU student would understand. Briefly mention the main features you plan to implement. Pretend you are trying to get users interested in using your system. 

      The website must be easy to read and navigate.
   
   2. Make a team schedule. Create a detailed schedule over the semester that shows all the times when your team will meet, when it can and meet, and when it can't meet. Take into account known absences of team members, holidays, etc. Be sure to note all the due dates of all assignments and exams for the course.

   3. Version control. Provide the URL for your team's SVN repository. Also provide instructions for how someone can checkout your project. _[http://code.google.com/p/project404/source here]_

   4. Create a risk table. In a table like the one shown, state each risk clearly, including its likelihood (e.g. low, medium, high chance) and severity (e.g. low, medium, high, catastrophic). For each risk, describe what you will do to prevent it, and what you will do if it actually happens. Think hard about these and choose relevant risks --- thinking about potential problems ahead of time can be can save you a lot of pain later!


==Comments==

_Well this isn't necessarily a difficult assignment but we really need to have a meeting when all team members are on site. I know there is a lot of grumbling about getting up and meeting before class, but until we have a meeting and can figure out times that are good for everyone, I might suggest we do the only thing we can and get it over with. Likely we could finish this off in a short period of time after we get an initial face to face meeting. Just my thought -- Mike


=Risk Table=
pg 106-110

Values for Likelyhood are: Very Low (< 10%), Low (10-25%), Moderate (25-50%), High (50-75%) or Very High (>75%)

Values for Impact are: Catastrophic, Serious, Tolerable or Insignificant

|| *Risk* || *Likelyhood* || *Impact* || *Preventative Measures* || *If it happens* ||
|| A member becomes ill or is unable to fulfill their duties || Low || Serious || Not much can be done about someone becoming sick, best to keep members posted on your condition and work || The remaining members of the team should come together to divvy up the sick/missing teammates work ||
|| Project gets behind schedule || Moderate || Tolerable || Keep calendars of events, set milestones, make sure all members know when their work is due || Make a plan to get the team back on track. Set incentives and ensure all members are utilizing their time wisely. ||
|| Project is "refactored" by Teacher or TA || Low || Serious || Keep in touch with TA and Teacher about their thoughts on the current project. Make sure to not try anything too drastic and time consuming before ensuring they believe it necessary or contributes towards the end goal of the project. || Quickly fix the issue at hand, and ensure that the correct information or plan is acted upon immediately with Teacher or TA's comments guiding this plan. ||
|| Teammate is constantly missing, shows no interest in work || Very Low || Serious || Make sure to keep in touch with team at regular intervals. Try to keep track of each team member's progress. || Try to push the team mate back to work. See if there are any issues outstanding that may be causing them to become lax on the project work. Try to work towards a solution with them. If to no avail, consult the Teacher or TA about the matter ||
|| Project hardware/software requirements outpace the computers at school || Low || Serious || Try to keep code relatively optimized. Additionally, make sure to consistently test the product so these problems can be caught relatively early || Try and debug the code, cutting out pieces until the culprit can be found. Maybe assign one member to find the slowdown ||
