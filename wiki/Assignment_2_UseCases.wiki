===Veteran Gamer===

Name: Max

Profile:  Max has always been a fan of the ultimate in tactics games. Having played them all, from fire emblem to final fantasy tactics, Max loves tactics. He's the kind of guy that will put his archers on a hill to gain that extra space of damage. Generally, Max says he enjoys the plot as much as anyone else, but what it boils down to for him, is careful planning, and quick decisive moves with little room for error. This kind of play makes Max apt to go with his strongest characters, seek out the best items, and generally specialize his characters to the maximum of their ability.

He just wants to play the game, and although he won't learn as much by doing so, he wants the accomplishment of getting through it on his own.
