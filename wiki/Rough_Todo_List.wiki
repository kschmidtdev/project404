#summary A rough list of what we need to do. Eventually this will be done in the issue tracker or using some sort of standardized (by us) wiki format.

= To-do List =

 # Make sure everyone is on the same page/is familiar with the tools we will be using!
  * C++
   # Coding-style
   # Code reviews before submits?
   # Code::Blocks+GCC or VS2003 or VS2005?
   # Documentation style (compatible with DOxygen?)
    * CPP and H templates (LGPL header on top, guards, etc)
 # Figure out what libraries we would like to use for what (if we use wxPython we could use [http://boa-constructor.sourceforge.net this] ?)
 # Start listing useful websites (like [http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/ this one])
 # Outline some example applications to use as drivers for our toolkit
 # Decide how/what the security component will do
 # Decide how/what the database component will do
 # Decide how/what the UI component will do
 # Decide what our team structure will be
 # Decide who will work on what
