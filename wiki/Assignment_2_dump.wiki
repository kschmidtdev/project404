#summary Place to put ideas/completed-paragraphs on assignment 2


= Guidelines =
 * The software will be written in C++
 * The renderer, and input will use the SDL
 * User profiles will be encrypted for protection
 * Game archives (data and database, if they are separate) will be encrypted for protection and integrity assurance
 * Our game will not be a clone or copy of the gameplay found in another game title
 * Our game will not include or use media or trademarks not legally licensed to us

= Data Requirements =
 * Input information from keyboard, joystick directional pad and joystick buttons
 * Database stored in a XML document which will on deployment exist in an encrypted form, and will be decrypted on the fly

= Feature Priority List =

== Game ==
 * Simple background music
 * Item store
 * Turn-based combat
 * Logging system
 * Simple configuration file parsing
 * Keyboard, joystick input handling
 * Computer AI (first level, does something)
 * Computer AI (second level, actually seems to do intelligent things)
 * Computer AI (third level, actually challenging)
 * Enemies
 * Items
 * Tile-map movement (certain tiles are impassable, take longer to cross, etc)

== UI ==
 * Animations during battles
 * Main menu
 * Over-map
 * Battle map
 * Tile-map rendering
 * Mini-map during battle map
 * Password entering/setting screens
 * Intro screens (Team404, etc)
 * Fading in/out textures
 * Scrolling text-boxes (for dialog, press a button/key to progress)
 * Item store interface

== Security ==
 * Encrypt an incoming file, output to another file
 * Decrypt an incoming file to memory
 * Password verification (hash incoming password and compare against a stored hashed password)

== Database ==
 * Load an XML document into a lightweight graph structure
 * Save a lightweight graph structure into an XML document
 * Supports look-ups (fast)
 * Search functionality for specific data
 * Support range query functionality (eg. get item with attribute from one range to another)
 * Store history of character's moves
