= Game Mechanics =

Questions we should ask ourselves:

What kind of turn Based?:

Player - turn based (Chess)
Game piece - Turn based 

How are we going to differentiate our characters?
How are these attributes which differentiate these characters be assigned?

How many characters will each profile have?
How many people on screen?
How are the characters created?


How does the world map work?


How big in scope and what features will be in

= Menu Operations =

_This is something that I think should be in the design documentation, but is not currently in assignment outline:  _


What options exist for (detailed descriptions):
  * Main Menu
  * Battle Menu
  * World Map

(This is obvious, but it needs to be described)

== Main Menu ==

 * Create New Game
 * Load Saved Game
 * Credits
 * Options
 * Exit

== World Map ==
 * Explore (move to adjacent spot on map)
 * Visit City (in which there will be Shop, Inn, etc.)
 * Load/Save Profile
 * Party Menu (to adjust 'things' about your party: equip, etc.)
 * Exit 

== Action Menu ==
_(menu of actions that game piece possesses in battle)_

 * Move
 * Attack
 * Magic
 * Item
 * Sacrifice :P
 * ???

= Other Documentation =

I believe that a State diagram (flow chart) showing different screens/operations that are performed is important, but is not explicitly stated in the assignment




= Functional Requirements =

== List of Actors ==
===Casual Gamer===

Goals: To play through a video game at their own pace, the casual gamer hopes to enjoy the game as much for its story line as he/she does for its in game play mechanics. The casual gamer is unlikely to play games for hours on end, and is likely to pick up and put down a game multiple times before finishing it. Usually they are unconcerned about gaining every attribute, and finding every rare thing, and are most likely to follow a linear and unending path to the end.

Abilities: Generally have a decent understanding of how games work, and if they do not understand, are able to learn relatively easily (through instruction). Usually have more patience than other gamers and are more likely to carry through and finish a game. Additionally are not afraid to seek out "help" and are more likely to search through FAQs or other information to ensure their experience proceeds unhindered.


==="Hardcore" Gamer===

Goals: To complete a video game in the shortest time, with the most skills and abilities they can amass. Wish to do the absolute best in a game, before others, and without aid or outside influence. Dedicate large consecutive hours towards a game not only until the game is finished, but also only until they have assured themselves they have done everything, and have "spec'd" (made the abilities of their character the most potent). Even then "Hardcore" gamers may stick around to show off their skills. 

Abilities: Generally have an encyclopedic knowledge of the game and it's minute facets. Having studied previous games in the series, and likely, having played other games in the genre, consider themselves specialists and elite. Have a low tolerance for hindrance, bugs or general slow downs in a game. Usually have little to no care about the plot, as it is only a means to an ends in the game.

 
==="Newbie" Gamer===

(newbie means a player new to the genre, game or both)

Goals: To learn a new game and to try and gain experience in how it works and what are the best options. Generally unconcerned about asking for information, they wish only to gain the best experience with the software at hand. Generally Newbie's have high expectations of games and hope to become better at them through time. 

Abilities: Usually have a strong sense of enthusiasm and start at a game with great gusto. Additionally, they are more likely to try out new things, and question how the game works as a whole. Their best abilities (in testing purposes) is their relatively new nature to the game, which gives great insight into UI and game design through their interactions with the game.
