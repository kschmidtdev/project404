<p>Name: Max H. Pearson </p><p>Profile:  Max has always been a fan of the ultimate in tactics games. Having played them all, from fire emblem to final fantasy tactics, Max loves tactics. He&#x27;s the kind of guy that will put his archers on a hill to gain that extra space of damage. When Max isn&#x27;t in his latest battle, he is talking with his friends about the strength of his units and their specialties. Generally, Max says he enjoys the plot as much as anyone else, but what it boils down to for him, is careful planning, and quick decisive moves with little room for error. This kind of play makes Max apt to go with his strongest characters, seek out the best items, and generally specialize his characters to the maximum of their ability.  </p><p>Goals: <ul><li>Generally wants to gain the most in physical terms (most characters, most weapons) </li><li>Loves unique and powerful weapons/characters </li><li>Is willing to seek out unique game play opportunities </li><li>Wants to crush the enemy AI  </li></ul></p><p>Abilities:  <ul><li>Good grasp of Tactics style games </li><li>Strong incentive to complete all goals and tasks </li><li>Relatively strong interpretation ability </li><li>Willingness to quickly identify information that will strengthen his game. </li></ul></p><p>  </p><h3>&quot;Newbie&quot; Gamer</h3><p>Name: Hubert Nuburton </p><p>Profile: Hubert is new to tactics. Lately his friends have all been playing tactics games, and he wants to give it a shot. However, Hubert&#x27;s friends are usually busy doing their school work, so Hubert has to learn on the fly. Although he has never tried tactics before, he believes that this type of game can&#x27;t be that hard to learn. He just wants to play the game, and although he won&#x27;t learn as much by doing so, he wants the accomplishment of getting through it on his own. At least that way he can gain the key to communication with his peers, and be on equal footing. </p><p>Goals:  <ul><li>To finish the game </li><li>To learn tactics style games on his own </li><li>To have something to say to his friends </li></ul></p><p>Abilities:  <ul><li>Highly Enthusiastic </li><li>Willingness to learn (short attention span) </li><li>Not afraid to try something new </li></ul></p>

Generally if he is focusing on something new he gives it his full attention. Thus including the volume and other options at this level suits him just fine. </p><p><strong>Screen Mockups:</strong>

</blockquote><p><strong>Actor:</strong> </p><p><i>Max:</i> Max doesn&#x27;t despise tutorials, but since he is familiar with the tactics games, he feels that utilizing a boring, long tutorial will not benefit him. Frankly it prevents him from getting his characters up to snuff fast enough. He would much rather get started right away, so he choose to not do the tutorial </p><p><i>Hubert:</i> Hubert isn&#x27;t exactly sure why he is required to use a profile, but since he wants to get to the game, he is willing to get one started. At least he&#x27;ll know he isn&#x27;t spending too much time on games. </p><p><strong>Screen Mockups:</strong> </p><h3></h3><p><strong>Name:</strong> Load Game </p><p><strong>Description:</strong> The user selects their saved game </p><p><strong>Actors:</strong> ALL </p><p><strong>Use Case:</strong> </p><h3></h3><p>Ordinary: </p><p>1.

Selection: Move the cursor to toward a city </p><p>2. Movement: By selecting the node, the character will move to this point  </p><p>3. Menu: Press the menu button to bring up the menu. </p><p>4. Selection: Navigate menu to &quot;Armoury/Marketplace&quot;(whichever is there) and enter. </p><p>Abnormal: </p><p>1. Selection: User selects node that does not contain a city </p><p>2.

He is unlikely to make mistakes as almost every tactics game he has played used some variation of a world map to link battles together. After some quick tinkering, he knows how the navigation works, and correctly assumes that cities will contain armories and marketplaces, because no one can get items from a blank node! Since the maps are relatively well laid out, he can quickly glean the information he needs to effectively utilize the map. </p><p><i>Hubert:</i> Hubert is quickly overwhelmed by the situation at hand. Relying on the tutorial, Hubert tentatively navigates around the map, but definitely isn&#x27;t sure of himself. It is obvious that there are cities and blank nodes, but he doesn&#x27;t necessarily link their relation to marketplaces/armories. He spends more time on this level, and is more likely to make errors, but he too will learn quickly as there are few ways to make mistakes with linear pathing. At the very least, he does recognize the need for the map, but does have difficulty with it. </p><p><strong>Screen Mockups:</strong> </p><h3></h3><p><strong>Name:</strong> Using Marketplace </p><p><strong>Description:</strong> The user must utilize the menu list to buy items for their units. </p><p><strong>Actors:</strong> ALL </p><p><strong>Use Case:</strong> </p><h3></h3><p>1. Selection: Move the cursor to select the type of weapon/spell/armor needed (Sword/Axe/Shield/Spell etc.) </p><p>2. Selection: Press the selection button on desired object. </p><p>3. Selection: Affirm selection with another button press. (item placed in repository) </p><p>4. Exit: Select exit option, press button. </p><p>Alternate: </p><p>1. Selection: Move the cursor to sell and select </p><p>2. Selection: Select the item from your repository with button press. </p><p>3. Selection: Affirm selection with another button press. (item removed from repository money given back) </p><p>Abnormal 1: </p><p>1. Selection: User selects an item they cannot afford (greyed out) </p><p>2. Selection: Game informs user, item is too expensive. Must select again. </p><p><strong>Features Used:</strong> </p><ul><li>Selection Cursor </li><li>Button </li><li>Menu </li><li>Database (storage) </li></ul><p><strong>Exceptions:</strong> </p><ul><li>Choosing the wrong item (error message generated) </li></ul><p><strong>Actor:</strong> </p><p><i>Max:</i> The marketplace is both intuitive and simple to Max. Judging from the amount of coin he has, and the items available, Max is able to view their statistics and decide which would benefit his units the most.  </p><p><i>Hubert:</i> Hubert will have trouble understanding the use of the marketplace. Since he has little knowledge of statistics and weapon stats, he will find it confusing and difficult to decide which weapons he should and should not buy. Additionally he does not understand (at least at first) which classes use what weapons, nor how to gain and use money, so utilizing the marketplace/armory early on will be difficult. However, the marketplace is not necessarily needed, since items can appear in game, so the marketplace may not be required to him. </p><p><strong>Screen Mockups:</strong> </p><h3></h3>
