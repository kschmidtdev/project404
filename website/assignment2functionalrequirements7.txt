</blockquote><p><strong>Actor:</strong> </p><p><i>Max:</i> To Max the in game status is imperative to his analysis of the current in game situation. By having it easily mapped to a single button, Max can quickly scan his team&#x27;s statistics, and, if needed, get more in depth information at the click of a button. He is likely to utilize this menu extensively while planning his next move. </p><p><i>Hubert:</i> Hubert has never really needed to know too much about his units. Knowing their basic health and power was usually enough to satiate his need for tactical play. He generally prefers to use the big and powerful looking characters, and finds stats to be boring. At least the stats menu isn&#x27;t obtrusive to his game play. </p><p><strong>Screen Mockups:</strong> </p><h3></h3>
