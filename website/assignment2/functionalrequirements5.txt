<p><strong>Name:</strong> Navigating the World Map </p><p><strong>Description:</strong> The user must navigate a map, and enter an item shop (marketplace/armory) </p><p><strong>Actors:</strong> ALL </p><p><strong>Use Case:</strong> </p><h3></h3><p><i>Normal:</i> </p><p>1. Selection: Move the cursor to toward a city </p><p>2. Movement: By selecting the node, the character will move to this point  </p><p>3. Menu: Press the menu button to bring up the menu. </p><p>4. Selection: Navigate menu to &quot;Armoury/Marketplace&quot;(whichever is there) and enter. </p><p><i>Abnormal:</i> </p><p>1. Selection: User selects node that does not contain a city </p><p>2. Movement: Player moves to position </p><p>3. Menu: Pressing the menu button brings up the menu. </p><p>4. Unselectable: Menu does not allow selection of Armoury or Marketplace. </p><p>5. Movement: Player moves until they are on a city. </p><p><i>Abnormal 2:</i> </p><p>1. Selection. User selects an area on the map where no nodes or roads exist </p><p>2. Movement: No movement occurs until a valid movement is proposed. </p><p><strong>Features Used:</strong> </p><ul><li>Selection Cursor </li><li>Button </li><li>Menu </li><li>World Map </li><li>Movement </li></ul><p><strong>Exceptions:</strong> </p><ul><li>Choosing the wrong position (movement but no marketplace or armoury present or selectable) </li><li>Choosing an invalid position (no movement) </li></ul><p><strong>Actor:</strong> </p><p><i>Max:</i> Max is in his element here. He is unlikely to make mistakes as almost every tactics game he has played used some variation of a world map to link battles together. After some quick tinkering, he knows how the navigation works, and correctly assumes that cities will contain armories and marketplaces, because no one can get items from a blank node! Since the maps are relatively well laid out, he can quickly glean the information he needs to effectively utilize the map. </p><p><i>Hubert:</i> Hubert is quickly overwhelmed by the situation at hand. Relying on the tutorial, Hubert tentatively navigates around the map, but definitely isn&#x27;t sure of himself. It is obvious that there are cities and blank nodes, but he doesn&#x27;t necessarily link their relation to marketplaces/armories. He spends more time on this level, and is more likely to make errors, but he too will learn quickly as there are few ways to make mistakes with linear pathing. At the very least, he does recognize the need for the map, but does have difficulty with it. </p>

<p><strong>Name:</strong> Using Marketplace </p><p><strong>Description:</strong> The user must utilize the menu list to buy items for their units. </p><p><strong>Actors:</strong> ALL </p><p><strong>Use Case:</strong> </p><h3></h3><p><i>Normal:</i> </p><p>1. Selection: Move the cursor to select the type of weapon/spell/armor needed (Sword/Axe/Shield/Spell etc.) </p><p>2. Selection: Press the selection button on desired object. </p><p>3. Selection: Affirm selection with another button press. (item placed in repository) </p><p>4. Exit: Select exit option, press button. </p><p><i>Alternate:</i> </p><p>1. Selection: Move the cursor to sell and select </p><p>2. Selection: Select the item from your repository with button press. </p><p>3. Selection: Affirm selection with another button press. (item removed from repository money given back) </p><p><i>Abnormal 1:</i> </p><p>1. Selection: User selects an item they cannot afford (greyed out) </p><p>2. Selection: Game informs user, item is too expensive. Must select again. </p><p><strong>Features Used:</strong> </p><ul><li>Selection Cursor </li><li>Button </li><li>Menu </li><li>Database (storage) </li></ul><p><strong>Exceptions:</strong> </p><ul><li>Choosing the wrong item (error message generated) </li></ul><p><strong>Actor:</strong> </p><p><i>Max:</i> The marketplace is both intuitive and simple to Max. Judging from the amount of coin he has, and the items available, Max is able to view their statistics and decide which would benefit his units the most.  </p><p><i>Hubert:</i> Hubert will have trouble understanding the use of the marketplace. Since he has little knowledge of statistics and weapon stats, he will find it confusing and difficult to decide which weapons he should and should not buy. Additionally he does not understand (at least at first) which classes use what weapons, nor how to gain and use money, so utilizing the marketplace/armory early on will be difficult. However, the marketplace is not necessarily needed, since items can appear in game, so the marketplace may not be required to him. </p>
