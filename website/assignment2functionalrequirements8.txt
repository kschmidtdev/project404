Selection: Player selects his/her own unit </p><p>2. Choose Target: Player uses cursor and places it over opponent before accepting. </p><p>3. Selects Weapon: Player navigates menu, selects appropriate weapon. </p><p>4. Attacks: Player affirms attack action. </p><p><i>Abnormal 1:</i> </p><p>1.

Selection: Player selects his/her own unit </p><p>2. Choose Target: Player uses cursor and places it over ally or blank ground. </p><p><i>Stem:</i>  </p><p>3i: Player has selected ground, this will only be allowed if attack is Area of Effect (attack damages more than one space, and may still be effective) </p><p>3ii: Player has selected ally, attack will only be allowed if &quot;healing&quot;. </p><p>4-5 Continue as normal </p><h3></h3><p><strong>Features Used:</strong> </p><ul><li>Cursor (and associated controls) </li><li>Selection button </li><li>Information button </li><li>Details menu </li><li>Weapons menu </li><li>Weapon/Spell </li></ul><p><strong>Exceptions:</strong> <ul><li>If a user selects the wrong unit or a unit who has already had it&#x27;s turn, the game will not allow selection.  </li><li>If a user tries to attack an ally, it will only be allowed if a healing ability if invalid, will wait until user selects proper target </li><li>If a user tries to attack ground, it will only be allowed for an area of effect attack if invalid, will wait until user selects proper target </li><li>Unusable weapons for selection will be greyed out, and attempts to use these weapons will not be allowed, waits for proper input. </li></ul></p><p><strong>Actor:</strong> </p><p><i>Max:</i> To Max this is all second nature. Using area of effect spells is something common in most tactics games, and in fact, using them on open ground does have benefits, including avoiding his own units, or hitting more of the opponents units. Although he may need to figure out which ways to best utilize this ability, he is likely to understand the gist of the games attack mechanics easily and early on. </p><p><i>Hubert:</i> Hubert finds the attack mechanics confusing. How come his archer can only attack units while his mage can hit open ground. He feels that the system allows him to make more errors than it should. Although generally manageable, he does require more guidance in this area to effectively utilize the attacking mechanic.  </p>
