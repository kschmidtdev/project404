Magician(special-attack type) can perform various types of elemental magic-attack to enemies(possibly multiple targets).

 <b>Character Template :</b> Since tons of characters are in the game, our implementation has a basic template class of a character and all the characters are derived from the character template class.

 <b>Code:</b>:</b>Blocks :</b> Code:</b>:</b>Blocks is a free, open source, and cross platform IDE. It is being developed in C++ using wxWidgets. Using a plugin architecture, its capabilities and features are defined by the provided plugins. Currently, Code:</b>:</b>Blocks is oriented towards C/C++.

Gamepads generally feature a set of action buttons handled with the right thumb and a direction controller handled with the left. Our game supports joystick because SDL can be easily adopted to other console platform(i.e., GP2X)

 <b>JPEG/JPG :</b> In computing, JPEG (pronounced JAY-peg) is a commonly used standard method of compression for photographic images. The name JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the name of the committee which created the standard.

In the battle map, a user can move to a certain grid to attack an enemy, to avoid from the enemy, or to obtain items on the field.

 <b>Newbie :</b> A newbie is a newcomer to a particular field, the term being commonly used on the Internet, where it might refer to new, inexperienced, or ignorant users of a game, a newsgroup, an operating system or the Internet itself.

 <b>Over-map :</b> Another word for World Map.

 <b>Party :</b> Simply, party is a group of user's character(or even enemies').

PNG is pronounced "ping", but can be spoken "P-N-G" to avoid confusion with network tool ping. PNG is supported by the libpng reference library (platform-independent), with C functions for handling PNG images.

 <b>Potion :</b> A potion (from Latin potio, potionis, meaning beverage, potion, poison) is a drinkable medicine or poison. In our game, potion is a item that restores a character's HP. Potion can be bought from marketplace or obtained during the battle.

 <b>SDL :</b> Simple DirectMedia? Layer (SDL) is a cross-platform multimedia free software library written in C that creates an abstraction over various platforms' graphics, sound, and input APIs, allowing a developer to write a computer game or other multimedia application once and run it on many operating systems including GNU/Linux, Windows and Mac OS X. It manages video, events, digital audio, CD-ROM, sound, threads, shared object loading, networking and timers.

 <b>starUML :</b> StarUML is an open source UML tool, licenced under a modified version of GNU GPL. The stated goal of the project is to replace larger, commercial applications such as Rational Rose and Borland's Together. StarUML supports most of the diagram types specified in UML 2.0. It is currently missing object, package, timing and Interaction overview diagrams (though the first two can be adequately modelled through the class diagram editor).

 <b>Status :</b> Status in game represents all the attributes(strenght, dexterity, inteligence and etc) of one character with their equipments(weapon and armor). status also shows the formation of party and any other informations related to a user's characters.

 <b>Turn-Based Game :</b> A turn-based game, also known as turn-based strategy (TBS), is a game where the game flow is partitioned into well-defined and visible parts, called turns or rounds. For example, when the game flow unit is time, turns represent units of time, like years, months, weeks, or days. A player of a turn-based game is allowed a period of analysis (sometimes bounded, sometimes unbounded) before committing to a game action, ensuring a separation between the game flow and the thinking process, which in turn presumably leads to more optimal choices. Once every player has taken his or her turn, that round of play is over, and any special shared processing is done. This is followed by the next round of play.

 <b>Tutorial :</b> For anyone who is not familiar with our game, we provide a tutorial. In this tutorial, a user can experience and be able to learn most of the basic controlls of the game.

 <b>Vector :</b> Vector (or std::vector) is a C++ implementation of the dynamic array data structure. Its interface emulates the behavior of a C array (i.e., capable of fast random access) but with the additional ability to automatically resize itself when inserting or erasing an object. Vector is a template class that is a part of the C++ Standard Template Library. It can store any type, but is limited to storing only one type per instance. It provides a standard set of methods for accessing elements, adding elements to the start or end, deleting elements and finding how many elements are stored.

 <b>Weapon :</b> Weapon is a type of equipment that improves a character's offence.(i.e., sword)

 <b>World Map :</b> Main map that shows the world of the game and all important places in the game. A user can move around the world map to experience interesting events, to fight with enemy, or visiting to a beautiful castle.

 <b>XML :</b> The Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a W3C-recommended general-purpose markup language that supports a wide variety of applications. XML languages or 'dialects' are easy to design and to process. XML is also designed to be reasonably human-legible, and to this end, terseness was not considered essential in its structure. XML is a simplified subset of Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML). Its primary purpose is to facilitate the sharing of data across different information systems, particularly systems connected via the Internet.
