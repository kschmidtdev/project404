Assignment 3: Version 1
Document Actions

  * Send this page to somebody
  * Print this page

The goal for this assignment is to produce a working version of your system that implements all the features you claimed would be in version 1 in your previous assignment. All such features are expected to be implemented. Plus, you program must be usable!

Coding, testing, and documentation must be intermixed. Whenever you write code, you should immediately test it and document it. Untested or undocumented features will be considered unfinished!

  * Updates to parts of previous assignments
    * Provide updated versions of all previous parts of your assignments. If some part of the assignment has not changed, then just provide a link to it. The code and the documentation must remain in-sync for all assignments.
    * Provide a link to your "issue tracker". We want to see how your team tracks issues, bugs, features, and so on.
  * Source code documentation
    * All source files must have a standard header that names the file, lists the programmer who have worked on it, gives the team name, etc.
    * Your group must follow a coding standard with all of its files. This coding standard must be explicitly written down. ([Here](http://www.sfu.ca/~karls/CMPT275/CppCodingStandard.html))
    * All classes/files should, in comments, explain their purpose, with examples if needed.
    * All methods are either self-documenting, or have clear comments explaining them. More important methods should have more detailed comments.
    * Add comments to the source code as needed to explain tricky code or hard to understand code.
    * Identifiers (i.e. names of variables, classes, methods, and files) should be self-descriptive.
    * The source code should be perfectly and consistently formatted.
  * Automatic Unit Tests
    * All your implemented code must be tested using automatic unit tests. This can be as simple as using assert statements to test key functions, or you could use a tool such as JUnit (for Java) or doctest (for Python).
    * For code that is difficult to write automatic tests for, then provided a written description of how it was tested.
    * Untested code will be considered incomplete!
  * Usability
    * You must allow other students and the TA/instructor to try your program during the class.
    * The interface should be easy to use and appealing, and your program should not crash or claim to have any features that do not currently work.
  * Organization and Teamwork
    * Be prepared to discuss how your team worked together, and if there were any problems, if certain practices worked well or not so well, etc.
